        <h1>Space Escape</h1>

        <h2>High Concept</h2>
        <p>A stealth game where the user tries to escape an alien spaceship. For the most part, the user will have
            to hide from the aliens that try to hunt them down.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Genre</h2>
        <p>Top-down, stealth, horror</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Platform</h2>
        <p>As of right now, it's only planned for desktops</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The player wakes up, unaware of what has happened and how they're here. They only have one goal in mind: Escape from this 
            unknown spaceship that's swarming with aliens</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>I'm aiming for an 8-bit style reminiscent of older games such as space invaders or more modern game that share a similar 
            aesthetic such as stardew valley.   
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The player must hide from the aliens that survey the level and are able to hide within certain containers when spotted. Enemies
            will be able to spot the player if they're within their vision range and begin to chase them. As the player progresses, more
            enemies will start to patrol each level in order to stop the player from escaping.
        </p>
        <p>Controls will be stated on the start screen of the game. The controls will probably be the standard WASD movement with spacebar
            to hide behind designated pieces of cover. 
        </p>

        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>My name is Duy Vu and I'm currently a 3rd year Game Design and Development student. I currently have experience in C++, C#, Java,
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Unity, and Python. I'm always interested in playing fun games with neat mechanics and am eager to try
